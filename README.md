This repository is not entirely my own work. It only reflects my learning process during the course: "React - The Complete Guide 2025 (incl. Next.js, Redux)".

I decided to commit progress (unfortunately in the middle of the course) and finally deploy most of the projects to show them in action - this also gave me experience in deploying applications and related problems.
